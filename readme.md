# Image describer

* Author: Oliver Edholm

This add-on gives descriptions of images for you by utilizing methods in Machine Learning.

Notes:
* The shortcut to get an image description of the current navigator object is NVDA+Control+I.
* If you configure another language than English, the description could have translation issues because it's automatically generated.
* Every time you analyze an image it gets sent to the cloud where the computer vision heavy computations are made.
* All kinds of feedback is appreciated! I'm reachable at oliver.edholm@gmail.com.
* If you are a developer and want to fiddle with the add-on, first run the deps.py script.
